			<p>With the CEO's Investment Fund including 11 people and 1 angel investor for the project, we have enough capital to complete the project until the end of phase 2. In case the fundraising fails, the CEO's Investment Fund team is ready to raise capital to continue the project. However, crowdfunding means a lot to us including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="mb-2">The community's interest and support shows that we are on the right track, our initial products have trust and are useful to the community.</li>
				<li class="mb-2">The capital contributed from the community helps us quickly achieve our goals and execute the project phases faster, thereby, quickly occupying the market.</li>
				<li class="mb-2">We save more time when we have the capital needed to launch the whole project at once, which puts us in a better initial position than our competitors.</li>
				<li class="mb-2">Gain community recognition with the DEV team in particular and with the entire ecosystem in general.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="text-center"><img src="{{ asset('img/subpage/news-kgd-coin-info-3.jpg') }}" alt="" class="img-thumbnail"></p>
